      <p style="margin-top:40px; margin-bottom:40px;">'<a href="https://youtu.be/klHpznbGeYc" target="_blank" title="c'mon youtube"><strong>C'mon</strong></a>' is the musical masterpiece co-written and performed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic!_at_the_Disco" target="_blank" title="panic at the disco! wikipedia">Panic! At The Disco</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fun_(band)" target="_blank" title="fun wikipedia">Fun</a>, and it's an absolute banger. It's one of those rare tracks where neither band "features", it's a true collaboration between two bands. 'C'mon' is by both Panic! At The Disco AND Fun. It's a rarity.
      <br>
      How did this single come to be, you ask? Well, in 2011 Panic! At The Disco were heading out on their Vices & Virtues headline tour with support from Fueled By Ramen labelmates FUN.. But before that, the two bands hit the studio together to make this piece of musical history. </p>

      <p style="margin-top:40px;"> They didn't even really know each other before joining forces in the studio revealed FUN. frontman Nate Ruess at the time, sharing with SPIN <i>â€œWe went into the session not really knowing much about the Panic! guys. But we came out, not only with what I think is a really good song, but with a couple of really great friends that we have a huge amount of respect and admiration for"</i>. A good start, given they were about to embark on a US tour together.
      <br>
      There's something so heartwarming about the frontmen of two different bands, singing about love together. <i>"With everything falling down around me, I'd like to believe in all the possibilities"</i> croons Panic! At The Disco's Brendon Urie. <i>"Don't leave me to sleep all alone, may we stay lost on our way home"</i> responds Fun's Nate. It's the kind of ambitious cross-over event that Marvel's Infinity War wishes it was. </p>
